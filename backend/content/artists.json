I am Sandra, and the lips of my models are my canvas. I create miracles on them, paint colors matching their character, expand their personality and create a wonderful result with worldwide individuality. Each painting is unique and that's also what I love about this job: I'm forced to re-invent design each time. It helps me and my art to stay young.
